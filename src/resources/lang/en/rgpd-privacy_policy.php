| ***** Instrucciones de traducción *****
| ***************************************
|
| Solo traducir la palabras de la columna derecha, ejemplo:
| 'aceptar' => 'texto aceptar'
|
| Respetar las mayúsculas y minúsculas
|
| En esta caso habría que traducir el texto 'texto aceptar' respetando las comillas simples.
| Hay etiquetas que son específicas para la maquetación del texto, IMPORTANTE!! respetar las etiquetas.
| Las etiquetas mas comunes a encontrar en los textos son:
| <br> <span> <p> <a> <strong> <div>
|
| Ejemplo:
| 'aceptar' => 'hola <strong>mundo</strong>'
|
| La traducción de este testo sería:
| 'aceptar' => 'hello <strong>world</strong>'
|
| IMPORTANTE!!
| Si hiciera falta poner una comilla simple en el texto, por ejemplo 'don't save' las comillas deben de estar
| precedicas del caracter \ para que no se tengan en cuenta a la hora de cerrar el texto, ejemplo:
|
| 'no_salvar'   =>  'Don't save'     *** ERROR *** la web daría un error.
| 'no_salvar'   =>  'Don\'t save'    *** OK *** el resultado en pantalla sería, Don't save.
